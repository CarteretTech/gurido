GitHub Copilot Custom InstructionsThese instructions provide context and guidelines for GitHub Copilot when assisting with development in this repository.Project ContextThis repository contains code adapted from the open-source Gurido project (https://github.com/Numonu/Luxury-Architect.git) and is being transformed into a high-performance, SEO-optimized website for cravenSEO. The project draws design inspiration from the Krypton template by CSSNinja and specifically targets small and regional businesses in Eastern North Carolina. The project is currently in its initial adaptation and development phase.The goal is to create a compelling web presence that is both visually dynamic and highly effective for local SEO, supporting the business objective of market domination.Development GoalsThe primary development goals are:Pervasive and Engaging Animations: Implement dynamic effects across all sections and elements to make the page "appear to be alive" and create a highly professional user experience.High Performance: Ensure the website loads quickly and runs smoothly, achieving excellent Core Web Vitals scores.Comprehensive SEO Optimization: Build a robust SEO architecture including schema markup, meta tags, semantic HTML, and performance optimizations critical for ranking local businesses.Responsive Design: Ensure a seamless and functional experience across all devices.Copilot should prioritize suggestions that contribute to these goals.Project Structure and Key FilesThe project utilizes the Astro framework. Key files and their roles include:src/layouts/Layout.astro: The main layout component, handling shared <head> elements (meta tags, preloads, critical CSS), global styles, header, footer, and loading global scripts. Includes basic Alpine.js for header/mobile menu interactivity and a scroll progress bar.src/pages/index.astro: The homepage, utilizing the Layout.astro and containing various sections (Hero, Trusted By, Services, How It Works, Results, Testimonials, What's Included, Pricing, FAQ, CTA). It includes specific SEO metadata and structured data.src/js/animations.js: Custom JavaScript for handling scroll-triggered animations using Intersection Observer, AOS initialization, parallax effects, number counting animations, and typewriter effects.src/styles/global.css: Defines CSS variables for branding, typography, spacing, borders, and shadows. Includes base styles, container styles, button styles, and core animation classes (.animate-on-scroll, .animated). Also includes media query for prefers-reduced-motion.netlify.toml: Configuration file for Netlify hosting, including build settings, asset caching headers, security headers, and redirects.Copilot should be mindful of this structure and suggest code that fits within these files or proposes new components/files consistent with this pattern.Technical Considerations & Best PracticesWhen suggesting or generating code, Copilot should adhere to the following:Animations:Utilize the existing .animate-on-scroll and .animated CSS classes and the custom Intersection Observer logic in animations.js for standard fade-in/slide-up effects.Use data-aos attributes for simple, declarative animations where appropriate, ensuring AOS is initialized and configured correctly (as done in animations.js).While GSAP is powerful and mentioned previously, the current codebase primarily uses AOS and custom JS. If suggesting complex animations or timelines, propose GSAP integration carefully, ensuring it complements the existing animation script rather than conflicting with it.Consider using Alpine.js (x-data, x-show, @scroll.window, etc.) for simple interactive elements and transitions as seen in the header and FAQ sections of Layout.astro and index.astro.Ensure animations are performant, leveraging hardware acceleration and minimizing layout thrashing.Strictly adhere to the prefers-reduced-motion media query as implemented in global.css to disable or reduce animations for users who prefer it.SEO & Performance:Prioritize semantic HTML structure.Include relevant meta tags (title, description, keywords, Open Graph, Twitter Cards) and a canonical URL in the <head>.Implement structured data (Schema.org JSON-LD), particularly for LocalBusiness and FAQPage, as shown in index.astro.Optimize images using Astro's Picture component or standard <img> tags with loading="lazy" and appropriate srcset.Ensure critical CSS is inlined in the <head> and non-critical CSS/JS is deferred.Consider preloading critical fonts and assets.Be mindful of Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) and avoid injecting content above existing elements after load.Suggest optimizations related to the netlify.toml configuration for caching and security.Code Style: Follow the established code style within the repository (indentation, naming conventions, comment style, etc.), consistent with the provided Astro, JS, and CSS files.Error Handling: Include basic error handling where relevant, especially in JavaScript code interacting with the DOM or external APIs.Responsiveness: Ensure all generated HTML and CSS is fully responsive, using Tailwind CSS utility classes and appropriate media queries.Guidelines for Code GenerationPervasive Animation: When adding new elements or sections, always consider and include suggestions for how they will animate into view or react to scroll, primarily using the .animate-on-scroll/.animated pattern or data-aos attributes.Integrate with Existing Structure: Suggestions for new components or code blocks should fit logically within the existing Astro component structure (.astro files in src/pages or src/components) and utilize the defined layout (Layout.astro).Utilize Global Styles: Use the CSS variables and utility classes defined in global.css and Tailwind CSS where possible. Avoid adding isolated, non-reusable styles unless necessary for specific animation keyframes or complex layouts.Reference Existing Scripts: When adding JavaScript for animations or interactivity, integrate with or extend the logic in animations.js or use Alpine.js directives as demonstrated. Avoid creating entirely separate animation initialization logic.Consider Business Goal: When suggesting content or animation styles, favor those that convey professionalism, dynamism, and polish, aligning with the goal of market leadership and appealing to small businesses in Eastern NC.Avoid Blocking Operations: Do not suggest code that blocks the main thread, especially within scroll event handlers.Minimize DOM Manipulation: Avoid excessive reading or writing to the DOM within performance-critical loops or event handlers.Modular Code: Suggest code in modular chunks that can be easily integrated.Comments: Provide clear comments explaining the purpose and logic of generated code, especially for animation sequences, scroll triggers, and SEO implementations.Placeholders: If suggesting code that requires specific selectors, values, or content, use clear placeholders or descriptive variable names (e.g., image paths, text content, animation delays).Code Examples and PatternsRefer to the provided Layout.astro, index.astro, animations.js, and global.css files for concrete examples of the project's structure, styling, and animation implementation patterns (e.g., data-aos attributes, .animate-on-scroll class usage, Intersection Observer setup in JS).By following these instructions, Copilot can provide more relevant and helpful suggestions tailored to the specific needs and context of this cravenSEO project, focusing on creating a high-performance, SEO-optimized, and pervasively animated website experience using the established Astro structure and libraries.

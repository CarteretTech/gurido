            Unfortunately, not. Because of the intense creative demands for
            delivering top-notch design and development within tight timeframes
            and the thorough research invested to achieve the best outcomes,
            Monomod's cannot provide our services without compensation.
            <br /><br />
             However, we understand the importance of client satisfaction. If,
            after our initial discussion, it turns out that our services do not
            align with your needs and no work has been initiated, rest assured
            that you are eligible for a 100% refund. Monomod value transparency and
            want our clients to feel confident in their interactions with
            Monomod's.
